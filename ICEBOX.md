# Icebox - Future Improvements

## Role System
- [ ] Disambiguate global admin vs team admin roles in the UI
  - Global admin: Platform-wide management (all teams, all users, global exercises)
  - Team admin: Team-specific management (their team members, team exercises, assignments)
  - Currently both have similar capabilities, need clearer separation in navigation and permissions
