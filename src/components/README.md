# Components Directory

## Structure
- `common/` - Reusable UI components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- `workout/` - Workout-specific components (SetLogger, ExerciseCard, etc.)
- `history/` - History view components (WorkoutList, SessionDetail, etc.)

## Guidelines
- All components should be TypeScript functional components
- Use named exports for better refactoring
- Include PropTypes via TypeScript interfaces
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
